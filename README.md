# DnD Frontend

This is a small project that was developed to assist in handling Dungeons and Dragons combat.
It allows you to automatically import AC/HP/resistance/vulnerability values of monster and automatically roll their initiative.
In addition, you can create your own monsters/players and save them to the local storage. These can then be imported into the current combat.

There is a built-in round handler at the top and you can also use the tool to track HP/temp HP/status effects and potential vulnerabilities/resistances that monsters have.
Last, but not least you can also save and load the current state of combat which allows you to either end in the middle of combat and resumse at a later stage or even prepare combat before the session!
